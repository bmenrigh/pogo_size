For a given weight, x, find the CDF bin where x is > the start of the
bin and <= the start of the next bin.

For example if x = 1.31255 then it is in the bin that starts at 1.3125.

Find the width, wb, of the bin which is just the start of the next bin
minus the start of the current bin.

Find the delta height of the current bin over the previous bin,
dh, which is hight of the current bin minus the hight of the previous
bin.

Now the CDF value for x is:

height of previous bin + ((x - start of current bin) / wb) * dh

That is, the amount this bin contributes to the CDF over the previous
bin depends on how far along x is in the bin. If x is right at the
start of the bin then the bin doesn't contribute anything and the CDF
is just the value of the previous bin.  If x is halfway along the
current bin then half of the height of the current bin is added to the
previous bin, and so forth.  Only at the start of the next bin does
the current bin contribute its full height.
